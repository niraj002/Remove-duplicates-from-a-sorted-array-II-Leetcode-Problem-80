# Remove-duplicates-from-a-sorted-array-II-Leetcode-Problem-80
What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?  For example, Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],  Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
One way to solve this problem is to use another data structue to store the frequency of each element and take care that the frequency does not exceed two. That will be linear time and linear space cpmplexity so;lution.
The solution provided here is linear time and zero space complexity solutions using two pointers and rewritting the original array
